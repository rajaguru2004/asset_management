## Vision

AssetFlow simplifies and digitizes how organizations track, allocate, and maintain their
physical assets and shared resources. It isn't tied to any single industry — offices,
schools, hospitals, factories, and agencies can all run on it.

The platform delivers:

- **Structured asset lifecycles** — every asset moves through defined states (Available,
  Allocated, Reserved, Under Maintenance, Lost, Retired, Disposed) instead of a spreadsheet cell
- **Centralized resource booking** — shared rooms, vehicles, and equipment booked by time slot
  with automatic overlap prevention
- **Real-time visibility** — who holds what, where it is, and what condition it's in, always
  current
- **Clean ERP architecture** — role-based workflows, reusable modules, and scalable design,
  intentionally scoped away from purchasing, invoicing, or accounting concerns

## Live Release: Auth, RBAC & Organization Setup

This repository currently ships the foundation of that vision — **Login/Signup** and
**Organization Setup** — fully working end to end:

- Realistic, non-self-elevating account creation
- A four-role permission system (Admin, Asset Manager, Department Head, Employee) with
  **live role promotion** — no re-login required
- Department management with hierarchy and department heads
- Asset category management with dynamic custom fields
- A searchable Employee Directory
- A live KPI dashboard

The next modules — Asset Registry, Allocation & Transfer, Resource Booking, Maintenance,
Audit Cycles, Reports & Analytics, and Notifications — are fully designed as detailed build
plans in [`docs/`](docs/), ready for the team to build out module by module (see
[Product Roadmap](#product-roadmap) for the build process).

---

## Features

**Authentication**
- Email + password signup — always creates an Employee account, keeping role assignment
  entirely in Admin's hands
- JWT login, session validation (`GET /auth/me`), and change-password
- Clean, generic error handling on login — no account-enumeration surface
- Inactive accounts are automatically blocked from signing in

**Authorization (RBAC)**
- A clear, auditable permission matrix (`Resource` × `Action` → allowed for each role) that
  lives in code — fast, predictable, and always in sync
- Role promotions via `PATCH /users/:id/role` take effect on the user's **very next request**
  — no re-login, no cache to invalidate
- The frontend mirrors the exact same matrix for instant, consistent UI gating

**Organization Setup — 3-tab Admin workspace**
- **Departments** — create/edit/deactivate, build a parent-child hierarchy, assign
  department heads, with built-in cycle protection
- **Asset Categories** — define categories like Electronics, Furniture, and Vehicles, each
  with its own dynamic custom-field schema (e.g. warranty period, plate number)
- **Employee Directory** — search and filter the whole org, and promote any Employee to
  Department Head or Asset Manager in one action

**Dashboard**
- Live KPI cards: total active employees, active departments, active categories, employees
  grouped by role, and the 5 most recently added employees

**Under the hood**
- Consistent `{ success, data }` response envelope across every endpoint
- Strict DTO validation (`class-validator`, `whitelist`, `forbidNonWhitelisted`) so every
  request is exactly what the API expects
- Full interactive API documentation via Swagger at `/api/docs`
- An idempotent seed script — reset and re-seed demo data anytime with one command

## Architecture

### Request flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Next.js Frontend] -->|axios + Bearer JWT| B[NestJS API]
    B --> C{JwtAuthGuard}
    C -->|"@Public()"| E[Controller]
    C -->|authenticated| D{PermissionsGuard}
    D -->|"@RequirePermission checked against\nthe RBAC matrix"| E
    E --> F[Service]
    F --> G[(PostgreSQL via Prisma)]
    E --> H[TransformInterceptor]
    H -->|"{ success, data }"| A
```

### Live role-promotion flow — the architectural centerpiece

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin
    participant API as NestJS API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Employee

    Admin->>API: PATCH /users/:id/role { roleId: DEPT_HEAD }
    API->>DB: UPDATE users SET roleId = 3
    Note over Employee: Employee makes their NEXT request<br/>with their EXISTING JWT
    Employee->>API: GET /departments (Bearer <token>)
    API->>DB: JwtStrategy.validate() reads the user fresh
    DB-->>API: roleId = 3
    API->>API: PermissionsGuard checks roleId=3 against the matrix
    API-->>Employee: 200 OK — new permissions active instantly
```

This works because the JWT only carries `{ sub, roleId }` as a signed identity claim —
`JwtStrategy.validate()` re-fetches the live `roleId`/`isActive` from the database on every
request, so a promotion is live the moment it's saved.

### Entity relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    RoleMaster ||--o{ User : "has many"
    Department ||--o{ User : "has members"
    Department ||--o| User : "has head"
    Department ||--o{ Department : "parent/children"

    RoleMaster {
        int id PK
        string roleName
        boolean isSystemRole
    }
    User {
        int id PK
        string email
        string password
        int roleId FK
        int departmentId FK
        boolean isActive
    }
    Department {
        int id PK
        string code
        string name
        int parentId FK
        int headId FK
        boolean isActive
    }
    AssetCategory {
        int id PK
        string name
        string tagPrefix
        json customFields
        boolean isActive
    }
```

`AssetCategory` is ready to be referenced by the upcoming `Asset` model — `tagPrefix` already
exists to drive auto-generated asset tags like `AF-0001`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Docker (for the local Postgres container)

### Steps

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajaguru2004/asset_management.git
cd asset_management
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
npm --prefix apps/backend install
npm --prefix apps/frontend install
```

**3. Start Postgres locally**
```bash
docker compose up -d db

*(If you are using a remote database, you can skip this step.)*

**4. Configure environment**
```bash
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001" > apps/frontend/.env.local
```
*(Make sure to update `apps/backend/.env` with your specific database URL if you are not using the local Docker database.)*

**5. Database setup**
```bash
npm --prefix apps/backend run prisma:generate
npx --prefix apps/backend prisma db push
npm --prefix apps/backend run prisma:seed
```

**6. Run both apps together**
```bash
npm run dev
```

- Frontend → http://localhost:3000
- API → http://localhost:3001
- Swagger docs → http://localhost:3001/api/docs

Run each app independently anytime with `npm run dev:backend` / `npm run dev:frontend`.

---

## Database Schema

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RoleMaster` | The 4 system roles (Admin, Asset Manager, Department Head, Employee) |
| `User` | Every account — `roleId` drives all authorization |
| `Department` | Org units with optional parent (hierarchy) and head |
| `AssetCategory` | Category master with `tagPrefix` and dynamic `customFields` |

Business rules enforced by the service layer: department re-parenting rejects cycles,
deactivating a department is blocked while it has active members or children, and the last
active Admin is always protected from demotion or deactivation.

---

## Authentication & RBAC

### Roles

| id | Role | Default access |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Admin | Full control over Departments, Asset Categories, Employee Directory, Dashboard |
| 2 | Asset Manager | Full control over Asset Categories; views Departments, Employee Directory, Dashboard |
| 3 | Department Head | Views Departments, Employee Directory, Dashboard |
| 4 | Employee | Views Dashboard |

### Live promotion

`JwtStrategy.validate()` reads the user's `roleId`/`isActive` from PostgreSQL on every
request, so `PATCH /users/:id/role` is effective on the promoted user's very next API call —
no re-login, no cache to manage.

### No self-elevation

`AuthService.register()` always sets `roleId: EMPLOYEE`, and strict DTO validation strips
any extra field from the signup payload. The only way a role ever changes is through
`PATCH /users/:id/role`, which only Admin can call by default.

---

## Frontend Data Flow

```
services/<x>Service.ts   (axios calls, unwraps the { success, data } envelope)
        ↓
hooks/use<X>.ts          (TanStack React Query — caching, invalidation)
        ↓
app/(admin)/<route>/page.tsx   (page composes components)
```

- **Zustand** powers `authStore` and `localeStore`.
- **`PermissionGate`** wraps mutating UI controls, checked against the frontend's
  `lib/permissions.ts` mirror of the backend matrix.
- **`AdminSidebar`** renders navigation filtered by `hasPermission(roleId, …)`.

---

## Default Logins (Seed Data)

After running `npm --prefix apps/backend run prisma:seed`:

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | `admin@assetflow.com` | `Admin@123` |
| Asset Manager | `maya.manager@assetflow.com` | `Password@123` |
| Department Head | `raj.head@assetflow.com` | `Password@123` |
| Employee | `sam.emp@assetflow.com` | `Password@123` |

The seed also creates 5 departments (including a parent/child pair: IT → IT Support), 4
asset categories with sample custom fields, and employees spread across departments.

**Demo flow:** log in as Admin → Dashboard → Organization → Employees → **Assign role** on
any Employee → they gain access on their next request, live.

## Contributing

Here are the collaboration rules in short:

1. **One module per feature branch, one owner** — branch naming: `feat/module-<NN>-<slug>`.
2. **Own your folders; append to shared files.**
3. **Each developer runs their own local Postgres** (`docker compose up -d db`, port 5433).
4. Shared files (`schema.prisma`, the RBAC matrix, `app.module.ts`, `AdminSidebar.tsx`,
   `seed.ts`) get **appended to**, inside a module-labeled banner comment.
5. Copy an existing module as your template — backend: clone `departments/`; frontend:
   clone `components/departments/` + `app/(admin)/organization/`.
6. Before opening a PR: both backend and frontend builds pass clean, every new endpoint has
   `@RequirePermission` + Swagger annotations, and RBAC changes are applied across all three
   mirrors (backend enum, backend matrix, frontend `lib/permissions.ts`).

## FAQ

**Q: What does this release cover?**
The foundation of AssetFlow: authentication, role-based access control, and organization
setup (departments, asset categories, employee directory) — everything the rest of the
platform builds on top of.

**Q: Why is there a `tagPrefix` field on Asset Categories already?**
It's there so the upcoming Asset Registry module can generate tags like `AF-0001` per
category without a schema change.

**Q: Why is the permission system a code-based matrix instead of a database table?**
Speed and clarity — it's a single source of truth that's always in sync with the code,
with no cache layer or extra table to manage.

**Q: How does role promotion take effect without logging out?**
`JwtStrategy.validate()` reads the user's role fresh from the database on every request —
see [Authentication & RBAC](#authentication--rbac).

**Q: Can a user pick their own role at signup?**
No — signup always creates an Employee account; only an Admin can promote from the
Employee Directory.

**Q: Where do I find the endpoint list interactively?**
`http://localhost:3001/api/docs` once the backend is running.

**Q: What's the response shape for every endpoint?**
`{ success: boolean, data: <payload> }`, applied consistently across the whole API.

**Q: How are IDs generated?**
Integer autoincrement IDs across every model, chosen for fast, simple joins as new modules
attach relations.

**Q: Why does Postgres run on port 5433 locally?**
So every developer can run their own isolated local database without colliding with a
default Postgres instance already on their machine.

**Q: What's next for the project?**
See [Product Roadmap](#product-roadmap) — Asset Registry, Booking, Maintenance, Audit,
Reports, and Notifications are all designed and ready to build.
